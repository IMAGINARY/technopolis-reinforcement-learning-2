# technopolis-reinforcement-learning-2

Technopolis (technopolis.be) version of the Reinforcement Learning v2 exhibit.

This variant of the original exhibit splits the functionality over two screens. It's designed
for two vertical Full HD (1080 x 1920) screens.

## Building

Requires Node.js (v18.19 or greater) and npm.

Run the following from the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled exhibit. This directory can be served by any web server.

## Configuration

The config directory has several data definitions.

You can override any of them in the settings-exhbit.yml file in the root of the built project.

## Running

Open `station-1.html` and `station-2.html` in two separate browser windows.
